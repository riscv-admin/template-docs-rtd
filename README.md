# Template for RISC-V Markdown Docs pubblished via the Read the Docs

This GitHub template is based on the Read the Docs tutorial
here:

https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/

The base tutorial is modified to remove python source code
and assume the documentation is built in markdown (MD).

The build process remains as Sphinx and template remains Read the Docs.

Type `make html` in the top level directory to build the document in `build/html/`.

For more information on using Markdown, see the
[MyST Project documetation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
